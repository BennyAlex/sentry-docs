The Cloud Resource Context integration adds information about the cloud platform your app runs in and adds this information to errors and performance events.

## Install

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

Add `CloudResourceContextIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.cloudresourcecontext import CloudResourceContextIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        CloudResourceContextIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Behavior

When the SDK starts up information from the cloud provider the app is running in is retrieved and set in all the error and performance events sent to Sentry.
The [developer documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/contexts/#runtime-context) list all the information that is added.

In AWS EC2 the context looks like this:

In Google Cloud Platform GCE the context looks like this:
