### Angular Version Compatibility

Because of how Angular libraries are compiled, you need to use the correct version of the Sentry SDK for your Angular version:

| Angular version | Recommended Sentry SDK              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 12 and newer    | `@sentry/angular-ivy`               |
| 10, 11          | `@sentry/angular`                   |
| 2 - 9\*         | `@sentry/angular@^6.x`              |
| 1 (AngularJS)\* | [AngularJS Integration](./angular1) |

<sup>
  * Support for Angular versions below 10 was discontinued in version 7 of the SDK.
  If you need to use Angular 9 or older you can try version 6 (<code>@sentry/angular@^6.x</code>) of the SDK.
  Please note that this SDK version is no longer maintained or tested.
